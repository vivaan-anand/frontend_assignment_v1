# Frontend Intern Assignment - Starter Project

This is a ready-to-deploy starter frontend project built with **React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS**.
It's structured to help you complete the assignment quickly and deploy to Vercel/Netlify.

## What I included
- React + TypeScript scaffold (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Simple desktop-focused UI: Header, Hero, Features, Footer
- Pixel-focused layout with Tailwind utilities
- Scripts to run, build and preview

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173/`

## Deployment
- You can deploy this repository to **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- On Vercel, select the folder and it will auto-detect Vite. Build command: `npm run build`, Output directory: `dist`.

## What you should update (to match Figma)
- Replace text, images and exact spacing/colors to match the Figma file.
- Implement any interactive micro-animations with Framer Motion if desired.
- Ensure all components have accessible semantics (aria-labels, keyboard interaction).

## Notes
This starter is intentionally minimal but production-ready. If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholder content with exact Figma styles (if you upload the Figma link or images).
- Add more pages (About, Contact) or a detailed pixel-accurate CSS based on the Figma.
- Connect to a backend or add forms.

Good luck — tell me what changes you want and I’ll update the zip.
